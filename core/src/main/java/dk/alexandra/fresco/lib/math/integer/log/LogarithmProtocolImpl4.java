/**
 * This class implements a protocol for finding the natural logarithm of a
 * secret shared integer. It is based on approximating the logarithm of base 2
 * using the bitlength of a number and then scaling it to the natural logarithm.
 *
 * Since the bitlength of a number is only an approximation of the logarithm of
 * base 2, this protocol is not nessecarily correct on the least significant
 * bit.
